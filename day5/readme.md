# simple linear regression
## implementation in python
## scope
Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent features.Linear regression is used in many different fields, including finance, economics, and psychology, to understand and predict the behavior of a particular variable. For example, in finance, linear regression might be used to understand the relationship between a companyâ€™s stock price and its earnings or to predict the future value of a currency based on its past performance.
### linear regression equation
#### y=a+bx
where a=y-intercept and b= slope, y= dependent variable and x=independent variable
we can calculate y-intercept and slope by using formula;
a=mean of y-slope(mean of x)
b= r sy/sx
where sy=standard deviation of y and sx=standard deviation of x. 
overall for b we get equation;
