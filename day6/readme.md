# NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER
In machine learning and data science, Naïve Bayes is a nice simple yet widely used algorithm.Naïve Bayes itself is a probability-based classifier algorithm. The foundation of this model is Bayes’ theorem
### Bayes theorem
![naiveBYES FORMULA](https://github.com/sajalozair/summerAIinternship/assets/138657622/507a66e1-99a3-4c70-a166-4e3221338b37)
using this formula, each instance get compared with each feature of every label(class) to find probability. and the class with higher probability will be consider as class of the that particular instance.
