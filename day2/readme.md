# report on basics of numpy, pandas, matplotlib
## Numpy
•	Numpy(numerical python) is an open source python library. It is the universal standard to work with numerical data in python.
•	Numpy contains multidimensional arrays and help to construct matrices.
•	Numpy provides ndarray--- n dimension array and provides various functions/methods that can be implemented on arrays.
•	We can install numpy easily. I  installed in cmd using command pip install numpy. once numpy is installed import it into python file that contains code. Import numpy.
•	numpy arrays are fast and efficient as they are store at continuous location in memory and occupy less space on memory. 
•	Various methods are available in numpy to manipulate arrays and matrices like; array indexing, array slicing, sorting, splicing, array shape, array reshape, array iterating, array search , array sort  and various logical, linear algebra and arithmetic functions.
## use of numpy in computer vision
Computer vision is a field in AI that allows computer or machines to see, observe understand and make recommendations. It helps systems to get meaningful information from images, videos or other visual inputs and make predictions and recommendations on basis of that information.
Image is represented as two dimensional array in term of computer vision in which each pixel is considered as element of an array. Numpy can be used  to represent images as multidimension array in computer vision by integrating with different other python libraries such as with OpenCV. Numpy methods then further can be use to perform various operation on images like resizing, shading.
## Pandas
•	Pandas is a python library use to analyze data and was created by Wes Mackinney in 2008.
•	Pandas allows to analyze big data and apply statistics. 
•	It’s functions include cleaning data, plotting, correlating data.
•	we can install pandas library easily. I installed in cmd using command pip install pandas and then import pandas into the code file… Import pandas.
•	in pandas the dataset is known as DataFrame and is best for tabular data.
•	Datasets can be imported in pandas in different formats like .csv, Json, excel, sql.
•	It provides different functions like manipulating textual data, merging data from different tables, splitting data, filtering data.
## use of panda in computer vision
Although pandas is not directly involve in processing and manipulating the images but it has various important functions in uploading data, and analyzing data after applying computer vision algorithms. Pandas can integrate with various other libraries of python like scikit learner or openCV  in computer vision programs. It can also use to handle and analyze data associated with images like labels, tags, paths, annotations.
## Matplotlib
•	Matplotlib is a comprehensive library in python for visualization.
•	It is use for creating static, interactive and animated visualizations in python.
•	It can be used to draw different types of plots like line plots, scattered plots, bar plots, histograms pie charts, stack plots, step plots, box plots.
•	Numpy is integrated while using matplotlib to create arrays(x-axis, y-axis).
•	Matplotlib can be installed in cmd using command pip install matplotlib. Most of the utilities of matplotlib lies under pyplot. Use import matplotlib.pylot as plt to import matplotlib in the  code file.
•	Matplotlib provides different functions and attributes to add give different colors, change width, height of lines and bars , labeling , giving titles, making girds and many more.
## use of matplotlib in computer vision
Matplotlib is useful in computer vision for displaying images. Matplotlib is not use particularly for analyzing the images data or processing it rather it is use for displaying images and can customize the visualization using properties like color, labels, titles, axes. Matplotlib can be use to make computer vision results represent visually in form of plots, pie charts, histograms.it helps to visualize and interprest the results in better way .
# difference between machine learning and deep learning
## Machine learning:
•	Machine learning is subset of AI that can automatically adapt with minimal human interference.
•	Can train on smaller datasets.
•	Requires more human interference to learn and adopt.
•	Shorter training and low frequency than deep learning.
## Deep learning:
•	Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to mimic the learning process of human brain.
•	Requires large amount of data.
•	Longer training and higher frequency.
•	Learn on its own from past experiences and mistakes.
# Difference in supervised and unsupervised machine learning:
The main difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning is labeled data.

## Supervised machine learning:
Supervised machine learning is an approach in machine learning that is standardized by it’s use of labeled data. Both input and output data used in supervised machine learning algorithms are labeled. These labeled datasets are used to train the algorithms in classifying the data and making predictions accurately.
•	There are two methods in supervised machine learning: classification and regression.
•	Classification algorithms divide or assign the data into different categories or classes accurately. Like putting spam emails in different folders from inbox. Decision tree, linear classifier, random forest are types of classification algorithms.
•	Regression uses algorithms to understand the relation between dependent and independent variables. It help to predict continuous output variables based on different independent variables. Linear regression, logistic regression and polynomial regression are regression algorithms.
## Unsupervised machine learning:
Unsupervised machine learning uses different machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms find hidden patterns in datasets without human supervision.
Clustering, association and dimensionality reduction and few methods in unsupervised learning.
